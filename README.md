# Blood Sugar Estimation Using Biosignals

## Overview
Welcome to Blood Sugar Estimation Using Biosignals! This README provides an overview of our organization, its purpose, structure, and guidelines for contributing.

## About Us
Diabetes is a chronic illness that affects millions of people worldwide and requires regular monitoring of a patient’s blood glucose level. Currently, blood glucose is monitored by a minimally invasive process where a small droplet of blood is extracted and passed to a glucometer—however, this process is uncomfortable for the patient. In this project, a noninvasive technique is investigated for the quantitative estimation of glucose levels in the blood based on Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and other Biosignals.
